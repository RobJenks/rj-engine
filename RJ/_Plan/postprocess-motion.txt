Bind extra full size RT for velocity output
Pass old projection/world etc. to shader for calculation of per-pixel velocity -> velocity RT

Motion blur passes: 
 - Render to Velocity-TileMax downsampled (size / K) RT
 - Render to Velocity-NeighbourMax downsampled (size / K) RT
 - Execute "Gather" PS process to combine into final post-processed RT
