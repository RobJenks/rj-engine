********************************
*** Tile construction status ***
********************************

Elements have a % constructed status
Elements have a % health status

Tiles have a % damage modifier that is accounted for when applying damage to elements

When applying a tile, 
   > Underlying elements retain their health
   > They also have construction % reset to 0 (although should already be 0)

When unapplying a tile,
   > Underlying elements retain their health
   > Construction % is reset to 0


Tiles have an aggregate construction % status that is calculated from all underlying elements
Tiles are only considered constructed when that aggregate % reaches 1.0



*************************
*** Placing new tiles ***
*************************

(*) New elements must be connected to the existing set of elements, such that there is a path from the 
	1) exit, if this is construction by an external shipyard 
	2) construction / storage


**********************************
*** Upon creation of new tiles ***
**********************************

Iterate through each new tile and work out which can already be reached (there must always be one based on (*) above)

- Of all these tiles, select the one which has the least workers already assigned (should give even distribution across building projects, and there should only be 1-2 usually since they must be reachable tiles)
- Or, select the one which has most assigned up to some threshold (which would focus-build tiles, perhaps better?)

Give worker the order to go and assist with the project


******************************
*** When working on a tile ***
******************************


If we have resources
   - Find a random reachable element within the tile that still needs resources
   - Assign sub-order to build with resources there

If we have no resources
   - Assign order to collect resources from storage

If we have no resources and no resources exist in storage
   - Warn player that we are out of resources
   - Return to engineering (?)


If we have completed the element construction
   - Repeat process where we have resources; find another element requiring resources and go there

If we have completed the tile construction
   - Notify player that tile construction was completed (except corridor)
   - Search for new tile project by logic in first section above and give that order, if one exists
   - If no other tile is awaiting construction then 
      - Return resources to storage
      - Return to engineering
