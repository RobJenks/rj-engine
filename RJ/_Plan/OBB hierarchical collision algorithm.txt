	Test box0-box1, return false if no collision, 
	else set collision=true, pcollider[k] = box_k
if (ignoring root0) and (not ignoring root1)
	set collision = false, pcollider[k] = box_k		(will be caught at midpoint if none of the children collide with 1)
if (not ignoring root0) and (ignoring root1)
	for each child of box1

			set pcollider0 = box0, pcollider1 = child, collides=true, break

	if (!collides) return false

else



for each child of pcollider0
	test child against pcollider1
	if colliding,
		set collision = true, pcollider0 = box0-child, restart i=0
	

if collision=false here, we must be ignoring root0 node, and none of child0 overlap pcollider1 (which is box1)
We cannot be here for any other reason: if not ignoring either root, collides=true, and if only ignoring root1 we have already returned false if not colliding with box0
We can therefore return false here if collision = false.  


for each of child of pcollider1 (which is either box1, or one of box1-children depending on ignore1)
	test child against pcollider0
	if colliding, 
		set pcollider1 = pcollider1-child, restart i=0		(no need to set collision=true, based on statement above will always be true at this point)


return colliding (which should always be true at this point)
