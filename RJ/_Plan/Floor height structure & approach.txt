--- APPROACH ---

Tiles need floor height data regardless, to determine where nav points should be automatically placed (if they don't exist)

However more complex collision with objects in the tile is only needed in certain cases.  E.g. for the immediate surrounding region of tiles.

> All collision is against collision objects
> Use spatial grid to efficiently test collision
> Still only perform collision for immediate surrounding region of tiles
> When creating nav nodes, will need to do a test to determine the actual floor height at the proposed node location




--- STRUCTURE ---

Floor height.  Store
- base height
- set of specific heights
   > xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax range
   > Either
      - height for this entire range
      - height at each of the four points, for interpolation
- int count of number of specific heights.  Can compare int==0 to determine if we just use the base height


--- LOADING ---

Loaded from file into vector.  




--- RUNTIME ---

On testing for floor height at current position
- if (floor height count == 0) return base height
- else
    for (i = 0, < count)
