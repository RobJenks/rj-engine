--- Top-level scoping ---

CULL: Use octree to determine only those objects in the immediate region that need to go through collision detection.  Anything further away can be ignored.


--- Broadphase ---

For each object in scope for collision detection,
	
	CULL: Use octree to determine only objects near to the object for collision testing

	CULL: For each object in scope, use bounding sphere test [sphere with radius = max(size.xyz)] to determine broadphase collision pairs

	Record items we have tested this object against; then when we come to test the other object we don't need to consider it (the reverse pairing) again


--- Narrowphase ---
